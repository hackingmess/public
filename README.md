# Public



I open this repository with the purpose to share interesting Public files from time to time in the hacking world 


Please be aware some of those file mile include malware samples of my cases, please NEVER download directly the files to your computer, use instead a virtual machine or a sandbox enviroment to analyze the data. 

Also be aware that all the files might not include the full details such as local IP addreses, URL targetes, enumeration of the OS and data to protect the customer privacy. 


In case of questions randy@atticyber.com


Have a happy hunting }:)
